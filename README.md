E-Learning Platform UI ðŸŽ“ðŸ“š
Welcome to the E-Learning Platform UI, a sleek and simple front-end interface designed for online education and digital course management. This user-friendly web interface was built using core web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and showcases a basic framework for an interactive learning environment.

Developed by Nuthalapati Harshitha, this UI project demonstrates how an e-learning portal can provide structured content, track progress, and embed learning materials like videos to enhance the educational experience.

ðŸ“Œ Overview
The E-Learning Platform UI offers a minimal and functional design, giving users an intuitive experience as they browse through educational content. The platform features navigational elements, progress tracking visuals, and integrated multimedia resources â€” all of which can be expanded upon to support a fully functional LMS (Learning Management System).

It includes two main sections:

Home â€“ A welcome page introducing the platform

Course â€“ Displays course details, progress tracking, and an embedded educational video

This project is ideal for students or developers looking to create or contribute to a basic educational platform UI.

ðŸŽ¯ Key Features
Responsive Navigation: Simple top navigation bar allows users to switch between the Home and Course sections dynamically.

Interactive Course Section: A dedicated page to display course content including title, description, and a progress bar showing how much of the course is completed.

Progress Tracking UI: A visually engaging progress bar with dynamic percentage to represent user advancement.

Embedded Video Learning: Integration of educational YouTube videos using an <iframe>, enabling multimedia-based learning directly within the platform.

Expandable Framework: Built with flexibility in mind â€” ideal as a base for integrating backend features, user authentication, quizzes, or multi-course functionality.

ðŸ§° Technologies Used
HTML5 â€“ To structure the content and layout of the web pages.

CSS3 â€“ To style the components and ensure a clean, modern look.

JavaScript â€“ For basic interactivity like toggling between pages.
